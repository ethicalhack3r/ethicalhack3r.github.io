        <section class="post-excerpt">
            <p>We are glad to finally be able to let you all know that ScreenStamp! is nearly ready for release and that we are looking for BETA testers!</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span><br />
</strong></p>
<p><strong>What is ScreenStamp!?</strong></p>
<p>ScreenStamp! is a project that I, 1337speak and cpbx have been working on for the past couple of months. Its aim is to be a fully automated screenshot application that will be available for Windows, Linux and eventually Mac's.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span><br />
</strong></p>
<p><strong>Another screenshot application??? Aren't there enough out there??</strong></p>
<p>Yes, there are lots of screenshot applications out there, however there is none that we could find that did exactly what we wanted. The idea came to us when recently undergoing a information gathering and vulnerability assessment, we had to capture screenshots of all the information that we had gathered in order to represent it as evidence. Every one in the group of 5 had at least 50 screenshots each, which all had to be captured, saved to an image editing application, date/timed, named and then saved to a file location on the hard drive. This proved to take a very long time when taking lots of screenshots!</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span><br />
</strong></p>
<p><strong>What does ScreenStamp! do?</strong></p>
<p>It has been designed to be as fully automated as possible, non intrusive, easy to use/install and free. Here are some of the features:</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span><br />
</strong></p>
<p>Takes a screenshot from the PrtSc button on the keyboard.</p>
<p>Puts date/time onto the image.</p>
<p>Names and saves the image to a preset location.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span><br />
</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where can I download it?</strong></p>
<p>ScreenStamp! Linux and Win are almost finished, we are now looking for BETA testers to find bugs and recommend improvements. If you are interested in being a BETA tester, please email development&lt;A&gt;screenstamp.co.uk and indicate which version you would like to test, Linux, WIndows or both.</p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;">'<br />
</span></p>
<p><strong>Other info:</strong></p>
<p>ScreenStamp! Win will be released as freeware and ScreenStamp! Linux as open source under the GNU General Public License. ScreenStamp! Win was developed in C# while ScreenStamp! Linux was developed in Python 2.5.</p>

            <p>Just to let everyone know that we are now running the latest version of wordpress, finally! If you haven't noticed already there's a 'Security Jobs' RSS feed which grabs RSS feeds off a number of job sites, the link can be found in the sidebar above the google ads.<br />
<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span><br />
</strong><br />
Ive fixed the footer as it was out of line and also made the pagination a little bit nicer however during the process of updating the site I seem to have messed up the 'pages', the ones in the green bar at the top. Haven't a clue whats gone wrong, spent the past few hours staring at CSS, PHP and HTML and still cannot figure out what I have done!!! I'm going to leave it for now and come back to it another day.<br />

            Abstract:
Any one can post an image anywhere that allows the posting of remote images, grab the http header information of any one who views the image and save it to a log file on a remote server. This has been done for a while by the advertisement industry to track users activities. It can also be used by mail clients to check that an email has been read by the recipient. It is known as a 'web bug'.

            <p>During our last information gathering and vulnerability assessment project our team realised that the IP address and web server software had changed from when we initially started out. Some time during the project the IT department had changed servers, which meant that some of our data from before the change was now obsolete.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span><br />
</strong></p>
<p>Some one on our team came up with an idea for a program that would monitor the server for any changes and notify us when it had happened. We would then know as soon as possible and could document this in our final report.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span><br />
</strong></p>
<p>The following Python code checks the web server every hour for changes in IP address, HTTP server header and x-powered-by header. If it notices any change it logs it to a log file aptly named log.txt.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span><br />
</strong></p>
<p>Here is the code:</p>

<p>Cant seem to find a change-log as yet, I think it has only been released in the past few hours. It was pre-released at Shmoocon 2009 a couple of weeks ago. I haven't downloaded and tested BT4 however I will definitely be taking a look once I have some spare time. Download it and let us know what you think!</p>

        <section class="post-excerpt">
            <p>Just bought an Acer Aspire One! It cost me £150 from ASDA (instore only), here are the specs:</p>
<p>OS: Linpus Lite (Linux)</p>
<p>RAM: 512MB</p>
<p>HDD: IDE 1.8" 160GB</p>
<p>Processor: Intel Atom N270  											1.6 GHz</p>
<p>Display: 8.9" 1024x600</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span><br />

<p><a href="http://www.ethicalhack3r.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/acer-aspire-one-mini-laptop.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-146" title="acer-aspire-one-mini-laptop" src="http://www.ethicalhack3r.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/acer-aspire-one-mini-laptop-300x257.jpg" alt="" width="140" height="120" /></a></p>
<p>The keyboard is not too small, it has a normal sized UK enter button, screen size is fine and its very light. You can buy a 1GB RAM stick that only costs £10 from crucial however to fit it you have to pull the whole machine apart. Why didnt they just install a flap at the base of the machine for easy access? God knows! I havent upgraded the RAM yet however I am considering it. The default user interface is designed for babies however migrating to the 'advanced' mode and the XFCE desktop was only a few clicks away. Linpus Lite comes with the XFCE desktop enviroment which I think is fine, I may change to another Linux distro in the future.</p>

            <h2 class="post-title"><a href="/2009/01/23/hacking-dect.html">Hacking DECT</a></h2>

        </header>
        <section class="post-excerpt">
            <p>Quite an old story dating back to December 2008, some how I must have missed it. DECT (Digital Enhanced Cordless Telecommunications) is a standard used for cordless/wireless telephones widely used in homes and businesses across the world. (UK frequency: 1880 MHz–1900 MHz)</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span><br />
</strong></p>
<p>A project know as deDECTed.org run by a group of German university students has managed to circumvent DECT's security implementations. Not by cracking the secret DECT Standard Authentication Algorithm (DSAA) but instead they realised that sometimes DECT phones used no encryption or authentication at all when communicating with their base station</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span><br />
</strong></p>
<p>When no encryption is used by a DECT phone the researchers found that with a modified 23euro PCMCIA DECT wireless card they could capture and record all audio data passively using their custom built Linux drivers.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span><br />
</strong></p>
<p>I have a DECT phone at home as I'm sure most people now a days do. It's quite a scary thought to think that with enough technical knowledge any one can listen to your telephone conversations remotely and passively. I'm sure they would be nothing interesting to be heard on my phone, apart from the occasional take away order, however occasionally I do contact my ISP or bank and provide them with my authentication details to access my accounts.</p>

        </header>
        <section class="post-excerpt">
            <p>The war between Israel and Hamas has spilled out onto the Internet. This is no surprise as cyber warfare has been going on for years. The Chinese launched the 'Code Red' worm when an American spy plane collided with one of their fighter jets in 2001 infecting 359,000 hosts in a bid to carry out DDoS attacks on high profile American computers including the white house. Georgia's government websites were the victim of Russian hackers back in August 2008.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span><br />
</strong></p>
<p>A website set up by a group of Israeli students is actively encouraging users to install software similar to that used by SETI to distribute its data to be processed by idle computers. The website <a title="www.help-israel-win.org" href="http://www.help-israel-win.org" target="_blank"></a><a href="http://66.102.9.104/translate_c?hl=en&amp;sl=iw&amp;u=http://www.help-israel-win.org/&amp;prev=/search%3Fq%3Dhttp://www.help-israel-win.org/%26hl%3Den%26sa%3DG&amp;usg=ALkJrhgtJO8m56udgWv52UhO60tGZxJkzQ" target="_blank">www.help-israel-win.org</a> is using the same software and technology to use thousands of computer's bandwidth to DDoS Hamas and Hamas supporting websites.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span><br />
</strong></p>
<p>From their website:</p>
<blockquote><p>We are a group of students who are tired of sitting around doing nothing while the citizens of Sderot and the cities around the Gazza Strip are suffering, NO MORE!<br />
We will not sit around and watch our children fear and cry out for help while the missiles are flying over their heads!<br />
We say NO MORE!</p></blockquote>
<p>At the time of writing this post they claim to have <span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: tahoma; color: black;"><strong>8039</strong> people that have joined them so far. </span>(not sure if this means downloading the software or actually registering and allowing the software to use their computers)</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span><br />
</strong></p>
<p>On the other hand there are also lots of hackers attacking Israeli websites and networks, this can be seen through out the black hat community forums.</p>

        <section class="post-excerpt">
            <p>Gary McKinnon's final court date has been pushed back to the 20th January 2009 (the same day Obama takes office).<br />
<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span><br />
</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>Prosecutors say he shut down thousands of machines and caused up to $700,000 worth of damage, while the 42-year-old claims he was searching for evidence of UFOs.</p>
<p>Over the course of the case, defence lawyers argued that McKinnon will face unduly harsh punishment for his actions and should instead face trial in the UK, since the alleged hacking attacks were conducted from a house in north London.</p>
<p>By the time the decision is made, it will be almost seven years since McKinnon ended his activities. During that time a succession of arguments have been made against his removal – including that he faces up to 60 years in prison or detention at Guantánamo Bay, and that he should receive leniency because he suffers from Asperger's syndrome.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span><br />
</strong></p>
<p>Let's start from the top, "$700,000 worth of damage". As far as I'm aware the American government have not produced any evidence to support the amount of damage caused. From what I've read so far Gary broke the Computer Misuse Act 1990 (c.18) point 1, "Unauthorised access to computer material" by logging in to American government, Army, NASA and other American institutions by using a windows null administrator password scanner. He may have broke point 2 of the CMA, "Unauthorised access with intent to commit or facilitate commission of further offences" by using the administrator account to gain further access to other machines or services on the networks. He may also have broke point 3 "Unauthorised modification of computer material", however I'm not aware of the full details. You could argue that he broke point 3 by viewing some of NASA's pictures, as by doing this he was changing the metadata unknowingly.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span><br />
</strong></p>
<p>He broke the Computer Misuse Act on British soil. In my opinion he should be punished in Britain. Ive heard about a new European cyber crime bill being discussed at the moment regarding liability, in short it means that if you leave your network wide open for attack then you are partly liable. However as far as I'm aware this is still being discussed and wouldn't affect Gary's case anyway as it wasn't about when he committed his crimes.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span><br />
</strong></p>
<p>Its been 7 years since his crimes were committed and he still hasn't been sentenced. I bet he just wants to get it over and done with by now. If the British government didn't see a problem with extraditing him then why is the process taking so long? There must be some disagreement at a higher level.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span><br />
</strong></p>
<p>For now we will just have to wait and see what happens on the 20th of Jan and hope that he wins his case to serve his sentence in Britain.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span><br />
</strong></p>
<p>There's also a demonstration outside the American embassy in London on Friday the 5th of December 2008.</p>

            <blockquote>A COMPUTER expert has been executed in Iran after he confessed to working for Mossad, the Israeli intelligence service. This provides a rare insight into the intense espionage activity inside the Islamic republic.&lt;/p&gt;</blockquote>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span><br />
</strong><br />
He was obviously playing a dangerous game and paid for it with his life.<br />
<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span><br />
</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>Ali Ashtari, 43, a computer and hi-tech equipment buyer for Iran’s defence industry and nuclear programme, was hanged after admitting he worked for Israel. It is the first known conviction of an alleged Israeli agent in Iran for almost 10 years.</p>
<p>Ashtari was trusted by senior officials to travel overseas to buy the advanced computers and other electronic equipment needed for the regime’s nuclear programme, which is reported to have already produced enough enriched uranium to make an atomic bomb.</p>
<p>Behind their backs he allowed the software he bought to be subtly doctored by Israeli computer engineers before it was imported to Iran. Ashtari confessed: “Mossad’s goal was to sell specialised computer equipment through me to Iranian intelligence organisations.”</p></blockquote>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span><br />
</strong><br />
You would have thought that Iran would have been more careful as to who they employ and how trustworthy they are. Who knows how many backdoors are still open within Iran's nuclear facility?!</p>

            <p>Meterpreter is a Metasploit payload designed for post-exploitation tasks.<br />
<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span><br />
</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>One of the steps involved in completely automating exploitation is post-exploitation automation. This is where steps are taken to automate the tasks that are performed after successfully exploiting a target host. The meterpreter implementation in Metasploit 3.0 defines a programmatic interface for the attacker that helps to facilitate this automation, such as by making it easy to interact with processes, networking, and the file system. While all of this has been present for some time, we have only recently added support for Meterpreter scripts. The purpose of meterpreter scripts are to give end-users an easy interface to write quick scripts that can be run against remote targets after successful exploitation. In the long term, we'll make it so that these scripts can run automatically each time a Meterpreter session is created, thus making the post-exploitation process completely automated.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span><br />
</strong></p>
<p>After playing around with it for a few hours Ive realised that its a very powerful tool for any pen tester to have. I tried in vain to record the exploitation and post exploitation process using the open source screen recorder 'CamStudio' however I was unsuccessfully due to it not recording some of the screen. I will try and find alternative software or have another go with CamStudio in the near future to show you all how powerful the meterpreter payload really is.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span><br />
</strong></p>
<p>Meterpreter has been around since Metasploit version 3 however in the newest version of Metasploit it seems that the meterpreter DLL that gets uploaded to the target machine is no longer detected by anti virus software. In theory Metasploit could scan random IP ranges, exploit targets using autopwn, grab the administrator hashes and then email them to the attacker. A script kiddies wet dream.</p>

            <p>While looking through some old DEFCON material I came across Sam Bowne's video presentation on teaching hacking at college. The presentation was at DEFCON 15 on August 3-5 2007. He speaks about the practicalities of teaching hacking in an academic fashion. Its a must view if your thinking of taking a career path within the security industry and thinking of starting a course in hacking.</p>
