            Report writing has a bad reputation, every one seems to hate writing them and believe it to be the anticlimax of the assessment process. I haven't been writing reports for very long, the reports that I have written I have enjoyed, no doubt in time the novelty will wear off and I will grow to hate them too. There are however lessons that I have learnt in my short report writing experience which I believe could have made my report writing that little bit easier and less time consuming. Those lessons I am going to share with you and if your just starting out in your report writing duties hopefully these can help you too. Or if your a report writing guru share your tips with me! The reports I have written are mainly web application assessments so I will concentrate on those.

I have decided to update the list as to keep the information up to date.

You who know me will know that I my self am enrolled on one of these University courses. I believe that if you're starting out in security and want to make a career out of it this may be the best place to start. For me the course has done wonders, not only in what I have learnt however the people I've met and the drive it has given me to succeed in my chosen career.

            After running Glastopf (<a href="http://www.ethicalhack3r.co.uk/2010/01/10/glastopf-web-application-honeypot/">Glastopf – Web Application Honeypot</a>) for a few days and not getting any hits, I was a bit disappointed. I speculate that maybe you need to give web application honeypots more time to propagate across the Internet and get picked up by search engines to receive any significant hits, or even give the honeypot its own domain name. From my earlier post you will notice that I had tried to get Dionaea to run first.

Markus the lead developer of Dionaea got in contact after he read my post and saw that I was having trouble getting it running. It turned out to be a complete fail on my part, after following the instructions on the Dionaea <a href="http://dionaea.carnivore.it/">homepage</a>, Dionaea installed perfectly fine, it was just a case of me not knowing how to run it properly.

<strong>What is Dionaea?</strong>
<blockquote>Dionaea is meant to be a nepenthes successor, embedding python as scripting language, using libemu to detect shellcodes, supporting ipv6 and tls</blockquote>

<blockquote>Dionaea intention is to trap malware exploiting vulnerabilities exposed by services offerd to a network, the ultimate goal is gaining a copy of the malware.</blockquote>

I bought an old battered PC over the weekend with the goal of installing a honeypot. I had never installed a honeypot before so wasn't quite sure what to expect. At first I decided on <a href="http://dionaea.carnivore.it/" target="_blank">Dionaea</a> the succsesor to Nepenthes, I had heard great things about Nepenthes from a friend of mine (<a href="http://infosanity.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">Infosanity</a>). After going through the installation process, I couldn't get Dionaea to 'make' with the right Python version detected (> 3.0), after about an hour of playing around I decided to give <a href="http://glastopf.org/" target="_blank">Glastopf</a> a try.

            I had a security breach on the blog over the Christmas period. To cut a long story short two black hats named HcJ and cyb3r-1st compromised another site on the shared hosting server, they decided to deface my blogs for a short period of time while they were at it. After talking to both of them regarding the breach it turns out they are nice guys (a bit misguided), they told me how they breached the server so that I could pass the information on to the hosting provider for them to patch it.

        <section class="post-excerpt">
            I started a poll last week on the 1st of December tittled 'Open Source Web Application Vulnerability Scanners'. The aim of this poll was to gain feedback from as many people in the security community as possible to find out which was their preferred open source web application vulnerability scanner, what they preferred about it and what they would improve about their favorite scanner. The poll has run for almost 7 days. The poll link was posted on Twitter (via my Twitter account), on this blog and on <a href="http://www.ethicalhacker.net/" target="_blank">www.ethicalhacker.net</a>.

<strong>
</strong>

The total number of submissions was 32 however there were some anomalies in the data mainly due to my own fault. I had originally included Burp Suite, I had confused their free version with it being open source, it turns out this is not the case. I also had submissions from application developers, I did not state that I wouldn't be counting their votes however I believe it fairer if we didn't. After taking out the votes for Burp Suite (3 before removing the option), the submissions from application developers (2) and submissions for other commercial scanners (2), it left us with a total of 25 submissions.

            I wanted to start reading the <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2616.txt" target="_blank">RFC 2616 HTTP/1.1</a>, because who knows more about how HTTP works than the inventors right?! The only problem was, is that I hate reading large documents from screens, I lose concentration after very little time and end up on Twitter or some other social networking site.

<strong>
</strong>

So I started looking for printed RFCs, someone must have put these in a book?! Well, it turns out that I couldn't find any. I thought about printing the entire RFC from my university library (£0.10 a page) however RFC 2616 contains 176 pages (£17.60 total). I remembered that OWASP use lulu.com for printing their awesome books, so I decided to print my own RFC and make it into a book. After many hours of trying to fit the A4 RFC into a pocket-size (4.25" x 6.88") book, getting the font size right, aligning the page numbers and getting the formatting just right on all 176 pages, 'rfc in your pocket' was ready to upload! After lots of trial and error with reformatting and trying to get the whole thing to fit I decided to order one for myself.

            When Microsoft launched their new Internet Explorer (IE) 8 browser in March of this year, it boasted a new security feature which filtered malicious scripting code to prevent reflected type 1 XSS attacks known as the 'XSS Filter'.

<strong>
</strong>

Cesar Cerrudo, while IE8 was still in BETA found a way to bypass the filter by using a '2 stage XSS attack':
<blockquote>A 2 stage XSS attack is when the user has to browse to a second URL after browing the initial URL for the XSS attack to take place, people may think that this attack is compliated and not reliable but it's simple and very realiable and has almost the same success rate as 1 stage XSS attack since people want to get what they were looking when browsing to the first URL they will continue browsing most of the time.</blockquote>

            <p>Today is exactly one year on after posting my first <a title="first post" href="http://www.ethicalhack3r.co.uk/2008/11/12/project-camelot-interviews-gary-mckinnon/" target="_blank">post</a> on the blog. I had a premature celebration (couldn't hold the excitement) by changing the design as you have all probably noticed. I am still working on he re-design so there may still be some glitches here and there, bear with me.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span><br />
</strong></p>
<p>I have come a long way since that first post and learnt a great deal. In 12 months I have created and managed DVWA to the success it is now with lots of help from the community. I have done talks, written articles and been a guest on some great podcasts. I completed my first year at university with the grade I set out to achieve and I am now half way through my second year still going strong.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span><br />
</strong></p>
<p>All this I could not have achieved with out my friends, family and the online security community. The infosec community is always there to lend a hand and has opened up great opportunity's for me. If you are an Ethical Hacking student or security professional and your not involved in the community, I cant stress enough how beneficial it is to contribute and learn from the amazing people that our out there. I would like to name names however there's so many of you that have helped me I'm afraid I might miss some one out.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span><br />
</strong></p>
<p>With out you the reader there would be no point in me keeping the blog updated with new posts, so please comment, give feedback and let me know what you would like to see more of. Also, don't forget to subscribe! Blue box on the right. ;) --&gt;</p>

<p>Again a big thank you to you all.</p>

            The World Wide Web and the applications that run on it have come a long way since the invention of HTML by Tim Berners-Lee (British man I might add) in the early 1990’s. Back then the World Wide Web was a static web of text, images and hyperlinks. Nowadays we have the privilege (sometimes not) of having whole communities which solely exist in a dynamically evolving cyberspace with wikis, blogs, social networking, video sharing and a lot more. “Web 2.0” would not exist without the complex web applications that run on the millions of web servers across the globe.

<strong>So how do we go about securing our web applications?</strong>
