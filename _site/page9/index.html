            <blockquote>Progressive rock legends Marillion are set to perform at a benefit concert for hacker Gary McKinnon.&lt;/p&gt;
<p>A concert is being organised to support the hacker, who the US is currently trying to extradite over charges that he caused $700,000 worth of damage when he allegedly hacked into US security systems at NASA and the Pentagon.</p></blockquote>
<p>This would be an excellent way to raise awareness of Gary's case and hopefully encourage a debate regarding the UK/US extradition treaty.</p>
<blockquote><p>Mr Hemsworth, who is also UK director of the International UFO Congress, plans to organise a ‘Band Aid style' song recorded at Abbey Road studios and hopes George Michael will sing Mr McKinnon's own single, Only a Fool. All proceeds from the concert will go to the Autism Research Centre in Cambridge, after Mr McKinnon was diagnosed with Asperger's syndrome in August.</p></blockquote>
<p>I wonder how much the tickets would be and what the turn out would be like.</p>

            <h2 class="post-title"><a href="/2008/11/20/metasploit-framework-32-released.html">Metasploit Framework 3.2 Released</a></h2>

        </header>
        <section class="post-excerpt">
            <p>The new Metasploit Framework was released on the 19th November (yesterday). It has a massive change log with lots of tweaks and add ons. I will try and list the interesting ones here.</p>
<blockquote><p>Version 3.2 includes exploit modules for recent Microsoft flaws, such<br />
as MS08-041, MS08-053, MS08-059, MS08-067, MS08-068, and many more.</p></blockquote>
<p>I think I may have to test my Windows 2000 box again and see if any of the above work.</p>
<blockquote><p>The Windows payload stagers have been updated to support targets with<br />
NX CPU support. These stagers now allocate a read/write/exec segment of<br />
memory for all payload downloads and execution.</p></blockquote>
<p>Staggered payloads are the only ones I could get working against Windows 2000.</p>
<blockquote><p>This release includes a set of man-in-the-middle, authentication relay,<br />
and authentication capture modules. These modules can be integrated with<br />
a fake proxy (WPAD), a malicious access point (Karmetasploit), or basic<br />
network traffic interception to gain access to client machines. These<br />
modules tie together browser_autopwn, SMB relaying, and HTTP credential<br />
and form capturing to pillage data from client systems.</p></blockquote>
<p>Metasploit can now sniff traffic too!</p>
<blockquote><p>Egypt's new PHP payloads provide complete bind, reverse, and findsock<br />
support for PHP web application exploits. If you are sick of C99 and R57<br />
and looking to gain a "real" shell from one of the hundreds of RFI flaws<br />
listed on milw0rm, the new PHP payloads work great against multiple<br />
operating systems.</p></blockquote>
<p>Will have to have play with this one!</p>
<blockquote><p>The db_autopwn command has been revamped to support port-based limits,<br />
regex-based module matching, and limits on the number of spawned jobs. The<br />
end result is a way to quickly launch specific modules against a specific<br />
set of target machines. These changes were suggested and implemented by<br />
Marcell 'SkyOut' Dietl (Helith).</p></blockquote>
<p>This is the feature used by Fast|Track, doesn't mention an OS limitation, that would be the next logical step.</p>

        </header>
        <section class="post-excerpt">
            A couple of weeks ago I was going to test Fast|Track against a Windows 98 machine however I couldn't get my wireless card to work on it and I couldn't be arsed moving the PC out of the spare room. I finally got Windows 2000 with no patches or updates up and running. I installed Windows 2000 as according to many its very vulnerable.

Fast|Track is an automated tool that comes pre installed in BackTrack. It scans an ip address or range for open ports using NMap, once it has scanned the machine(s) it trys every exploit for the open ports found using NMap's autopwn feature via Metasploit. It doesn't take any notice of NMap's OS discovery, so even if NMap discovers that the machine is running Windows 2000 with 100% accuracy (it didn't), it will still try other OS exploits.

After Fast|Track had finished scanning and exploiting It gave me 4 active shell sessions that it had spawned from successful exploits.

        </header>
        <section class="post-excerpt">
            <p><strong>What is it?</strong></p>
<p>nUbuntu is an Ubuntu live CD with all the desktop packages removed, like gnome, evolution, open office and most other packages which come installed in Ubuntu by default. It comes with many security packages pre installed and ready to use. It could be compared to other security live Cd's like BackTrack or Auditor.</p>
<p><strong>Where to get it?</strong></p>
<p><a title="nubuntu download" href="http://www.nubuntu.org/downloads.php" target="_blank">http://www.nubuntu.org/downloads.php</a></p>
<p><strong>How do you install it?</strong></p>
<p>You can download the ISO image file, burn it to CD and boot it. What I chose to do was download the ISO image file and make a virtual machine image, so I could run it straight from my desktop as I do with BackTrack.</p>
<p>Here's a guide on how to create a virtual machine from an ISO image file using VMWare:</p>
<p><a title="creat vmware from iso" href="http://www.howtoforge.com/create-vmware-machines-from-iso-files-without-burning-cds-dvds" target="_blank">http://www.howtoforge.com/create-vmware-machines-from-iso-files-without-burning-cds-dvds</a></p>
<p><strong>What do I think?</strong></p>
<p>It works well, had no problems while booting. I like the fact that all the fancy Ubuntu stuff has been taken out. As for the pre installed scripts and tools (which is what were most interested in), It doesnt have as many tools pre installed as BackTrack does, however it does have some tools which BackTrack doesn't have. A couple of examples would be Wapiti, Nessus and Onesixtyone. It also has an option to install to HDD which BackTrack doesn't have, but the point of a live CD is to boot from the CD, its always nice to have the option tho. I like the fact that BackTrack has FTP, VNC and other server software pre installed, nUbuntu doesnt.  All in all  I think i will be sticking with BackTrack for now, however I will be keeping a close eye on this one.</p>
<p><strong>What do you think?</strong></p>
<p>I don't know! Download it and let me know!</p>

        </header>
        <section class="post-excerpt">
            <p>I was on my way to work some time last year when I saw an ATM with a DOS prompt on the screen. So I went over to have a look and took some pics on my mobile phone. The pictures I took revealed that the ATM was running Windows 95. Yes, you read right, Windows 95!!!</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ethicalhack3r.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/dsc00098.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-24" title="dsc00098" src="http://www.ethicalhack3r.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/dsc00098-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a></p>
<p>According to Secunia:</p>
<p>Windows 95 has 7 advisories with 3 of them unpatched. (As Microsoft doesn't support Windows 95 anymore they will never be patched.)</p>
<p><img class="alignnone" title="Solution Status" src="http://secunia.com/advisories/graph/?type=sol&amp;period=all&amp;prod=393" alt="" width="443" height="230" /></p>
<p><img class="alignnone" title="Criticality" src="http://secunia.com/advisories/graph/?type=cri&amp;period=all&amp;prod=393" alt="" width="443" height="230" /></p>
<p><img class="alignnone" title="Where" src="http://secunia.com/advisories/graph/?type=fro&amp;period=all&amp;prod=393" alt="" width="443" height="230" /></p>
<p><img class="alignnone" title="Impact" src="http://secunia.com/advisories/graph/?type=imp&amp;period=all&amp;prod=393" alt="" width="443" height="300" /></p>
<p>As you can see Windows 95 is not a very safe OS to run, never mind on an ATM! Lets summarise the graphs above. 50% unpatched, 75% remotely and 50% system access.</p>
<p>So the question is, how safe is your money? Not very by the looks of it.</p>

            <p>Quite an old video, <span id="duration-and-date"><span class="date">Nov 9, 2007</span></span>. Its interesting to hear Gary's defence straight from the horses mouth. At first when I heard his defence, I thought 'Yea, right! Hes just saying that to try and get a lesser sentence'. After seeing this video he has convinced me that he really was looking for evidence of extraterrestrials and renewable energy. He says that he saw an image of a UFO on one of the NASA machines he hacked and that it was no fake. He used a windows blank administrator password scanner, using remote desktop on a 56k modem. The only remote desktop hacking tools for windows which I'm aware of are TSGrinder and TSCrack, so he must have used one of those.</p>
<p>If your unfamiliar with his case, take a look at <a title="Free Gary" href="http://www.freegary.org.uk" target="_blank">http://www.freegary.org.uk</a></p>
<p>Here's the video:</p>
