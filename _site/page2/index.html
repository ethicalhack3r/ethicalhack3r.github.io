        <section class="post-excerpt">
            WordPress 3.5 was recently released which now comes with the WordPress API "always enabled". Personally I think this adds unnecessary risk by increasing the attack surface. How many WordPress user's actually use the API? I would put my money on it being a very small fraction, either way I'm sure the WordPress Core Development team had good reason to enable the API by default. After spending 5 minutes looking for where to turn the API off in WordPress 3.5 I gave up. Huh, I'll have another look sometime soon.

I've had a play with the API in the past, however, I've always found it hard to get going as the information on how to interact with the API is a bit sparse. Having played with it for an hour or so this evening I thought I'd share some of the information on how to get started (as well as a self reminder ;).

The latest API calls can be found on WordPress's Codex <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/XML-RPC_WordPress_API" target="_blank">here</a>. It doesn't list all available calls, to find these let's extract them from the 'wp-includes/class-wp-xmlrpc-server.php' file.

            <p>This is the paper that I submitted for my undergraduate dissertation in Ethical Hacking for Computer Security. The title (a mouth full) 'Implementing Basic Static Code Analysis into Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) to Reduce Software Vulnerabilities'. The paper talks about software security, modern software development, software development life cycles, static code analysis and a lot more. Since submitting it I have noticed some mistakes so I'm not putting this out there as a 'perfect paper'.</p>

<p>The paper was the research and implementation of <a href="http://www.devbug.co.uk" target="_blank">DevBug</a> an online PHP Static Code Analysis tool written mostly in JavaScript.</p>

<p>Feel free to have a read through, I won't be making any future amendments as I was sick of looking at it by the time I submitted it but I thought I would put it out there incase it was useful to others in learning about software security. It is a bit dry in places, be warned!</p>

            A few weeks a go I had an idea.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p>JavaScript Taint Analysis for DOM <a href="https://twitter.com/search/%2523XSS">#XSS</a> in Burp would be an awesome feature to have! // cc: @<a href="https://twitter.com/portswigger">portswigger</a></p>&mdash; Ryan Dewhurst (@ethicalhack3r) <a href="https://twitter.com/ethicalhack3r/status/218459472450961408" data-datetime="2012-06-28T21:42:51+00:00">June 28, 2012</a></blockquote>
<script src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

When I get ideas that I think have something worth while in them I note them down for future reference.

The three main points to get this working were:

<li>Take Burp response body.</li>
<li>Extract JavaScript.</li>
<li>Perform Taint Analysis.</li>

The first step was to somehow extract HTML responses from Burp Suite, luckily someone had already written a Ruby Burp extender called <a href="http://emonti.github.com/buby/">Buby</a>. I followed <a href="http://carnal0wnage.attackresearch.com/2011/05/buby-script-basics-part-1.html">this</a> awesome series of blog posts to get myself aquatinted with Buby.

The next step is to extract the JavaScript from the HTML responses, this is quite trivial to do with the <a href="http://nokogiri.org/">Nokogiri</a> Ruby gem.

The third step is to analyse the extracted JavaScript for Sinks, Sources and Securing functions (Taint Analysis). This was the hard part, for me at least. Finding this information proved to be hard, I did find some data, however, in the end this is where I stopped pursuing my idea.

        <section class="post-excerpt">
            My final year university dissertation was on the topic of Static Code Analysis, specifically the integration of IDEs (Integrated Development Environments) with Static Code Analysis. The idea was to make Static Code Analysis accesible to the developer, without them having to install and use additional specialist Static Code Analysis software.

Due to my familiarity with PHP and its lack of interpreter taint analysis I decided that I would write a PHP Static Code Analysis application. The PHP Static Code Analysis tool I developed is called DevBug, it is an online PHP Static Code Analysis tool written mostly in JavaScript (jQuery). The Static Code Analysis engine uses the sources, securing functions and sinks data from the awesome <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/rips-scanner/" target="_blank">RIPS</a> Static Code Analysis tool to identify specific PHP functions that can cause or remediate user input caused vulnerabilities. DevBug uses Taint Analysis to identify tainted variables, follows the tainted variables through the code, untaints the variables if they are secured and finally detects whether or not tainted variables end up in in sensitive sinks.

The IDE used is called <a href="http://codemirror.net/" target="_blank">CodeMirror</a> that provides a code editing area, syntax highlighting, line numbering and an API. CodeMirror was slightly modified to detect deprecated PHP functions and highlight them.

            Back in the late nineties, around 1999, my mother bought me my first computer. Around this time The Matrix movie was released which as a young boy with a new computer had me Yahoo'ing (Google was largely unknown) for the term 'hacking'. Back then Yahoo! Chat was still around and had a chat room called the 'Hackers Lounge', everyone in there was talking about all sorts of cool things you could do with computers that I had never heard of before. With hindsight, most of the people in the chat room were script kiddies who knew how to run a few Windows GUI 'hacking' tools and largely acting like they were the kings of the Internet. At the time I wanted to learn about all of the cool things they knew. I started downloading and learning how to use these 'hacking' tools by the use of my guinea pig friends and family (my siblings soon grew tired of me remotely opening and closing their CD-ROM drives).

Some of these tools are still actively developed and used today, invaluable to conducting modern Penetration Testing and security audits. For the sake of nostalgia, I present to you some of the coolest most 1337 'hacking' tools that I and others used 'back in the day'. Warning: Download links not verified.

        </header>
        <section class="post-excerpt">
            Yesterday two Indian security researchers, Aditya Modha & Samir Shah, released an <a href="http://oldmanlab.blogspot.com/2012/01/wordpress-33-xss-vulnerability.html" target="_blank">advisory</a> outlining a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability within the latest version (at the time of writing) of WordPress 3.3. Many people started re-tweeting the news (including myself) and <a href="http://thehackernews.com/2012/01/zero-day-reflected-cross-site-scripting.html" target="_blank">blogging</a> about it. The problem came when I tried to reproduce the vulnerability, I couldn't.

I started to think that the vulnerability was a miss-understanding or publicity stunt and was getting annoyed at the many people who were spreading miss-information. I contacted the researchers over <a href="http://www.twitter.com/oldmanlab" target="_blank">Twitter</a> and told them that I was unable to reproduce the vulnerability in any browser or on any WordPress installation including vanilla installs.

The researchers got back in touch with a link to a WordPress installation on which the vulnerability worked. The URL they gave me was an IP address. Within their environment the XSS worked.

At this point I think even the researchers were puzzled. They sent me this code that they believed was the function causing the XSS within wp-includes/functions.php <a href="http://pastebin.com/iBnpN8Zm" target="_blank">http://pastebin.com/iBnpN8Zm</a>.

            The EC-Council or 'The International Council of E-Commerce Consultants' as they like to call themselves offer a range of different services, mostly in the field of Information Security training and certifications. One of their certifications, the Certified Ethical Hacker (CEH) claims to aspire to training 'ethical' hackers. 

<blockquote>"CEHv7 provides a comprehensive ethical hacking and network security-training program to meet the standards of highly skilled security professionals."</blockquote>

What I have found is the way the EC-Council promote their CEH is less than ethical and damn right unethical.

A comment left on my blog quite a while ago (2010/04/20 at 6:18 am), looked fairly authentic, however, when investigating a little further it was clear to me that the comment was in fact SPAM.

<blockquote>"smith said...
