        <h1 class="post-title">BruCON 5by5 - WPScan Online Vulnerability Database</h1>

        <section class="post-content">
            <p>For those of you who have been living under a rock, <a href="http://2014.brucon.org/index.php/Main_Page">BruCON</a> is a security conference held every year in Belgium (originally Brussels, now Ghent). I have attended every BruCON conference since the second. Last year was the 5th time the conference had been held (correct me if I'm wrong) and so the year before (2012) they setup what they called <a href="http://blog.brucon.org/2012/10/announcing-brucon-5by5.html">5by5</a>. This allowed BruCON, as it's a non-for-profit, to share its extra left over cash by supporting community projects.</p>

<p>Last year, they allocated <a href="http://blog.brucon.org/2013/02/the-5by5-race-is-on.html">up to 5,000 euros to 4 different community projects</a>. These projects were:</p>

<p>1. OWASP OWTF (Abraham Aranguren)<br />
2. The Cloudbug Project (Carlos Garcia Prado)<br />
3. A tool a month (Robin Wood)<br />
4. Eccentric Authentication (Guido Witmond)</p>
<p>As last year was such a success, they're doing it again this year! And this year I put in a proposal!</p>
<p><a id="more"></a><a id="more-17216"></a></p>
<p>My initial proposal, which never left my desktop, was to spend some time working on <a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Testing_Guide_v4_Table_of_Contents">OWASP's Testing Guide version 4</a>. I had already contributed a little to this project and thought the 5by5 project would incentivise me to contribute a lot more to it. The proposal included creating automated tools to spell check the guide, other tools to check for broken links, writing a bunch of pages and reviewing a bunch more. The problem with this initial idea was that the Testing Guide's release date was planned and I was afraid my BruCON 5by5 proposal would get accepted when the guide had already been released.</p>
<p>My second proposal, which I actually submitted, was to create a <a href="http://wpscan.org/">WPScan</a> online vulnerability database. For those unfamiliar with WPScan, it is a black box WordPress vulnerability scanner which I started a few years a go and has since become a very successful project thanks to a great team of core developers (WPScan Team).</p>
<p>One of WPScan's key assets is its databases of WordPress vulnerabilities which are updated on an almost daily basis by the WPScan Team. The team have had the idea for a while to make these, that are currently XML files, into an online browsable web application. Allowing users to easily browse WordPress vulnerabilities (including core, plugins and themes), comment on them, submit vulnerabilities, rate them, etc. Making them more visible and accessible to WordPress admins, users and the security community.</p>
<p>At the time of writing these are the database stats (they can be obtained by running wpstools.rb --stats):</p>
<p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">[#] Total vulnerable versions: 78
[#] Total vulnerable plugins:  693
[#] Total vulnerable themes:   251

[#] Total version vulnerabilities: 291
[#] Total plugin vulnerabilities:  1016
[#] Total theme vulnerabilities:   283</code></pre></div>
</p>

<p>My personal deadline for the online vulnerability database is the 1st of August 2014. I decided to write the online vulnerability database in Rails, as WPScan itself is written in Ruby. As I've never written any Rails applications before I purchased '<a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Agile-Development-Rails-Pragmatic-Programmers/dp/1937785564">Agile Web Development with Rails 4</a>' from Amazon which I have just started reading.</p>

<p>I'd like to thank BruCON for giving me the opportunity to work on the WordPress online vulnerability database project for WPScan. And I look forward to learning Rails and developing with it! See you all at BruCON!</p>
